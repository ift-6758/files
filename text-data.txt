a fool always rushes to the fore
a fool and his money are soon parted
a fool at forty is a fool indeed
a fool may ask more questions in an hour than a wise man can answer in seven years
a fool may throw a stone into a well which a hundred wise men cannot pull out
a fool tongue runs before his wit
a forced kindness deserves no thanks
a foul morn may turn to a fair day
a fox is not taken twice in the same snare
a friend in need is a friend indeed
a friend is never known till needed
a friend to all is a friend to none
a friend frown is better than a foe smile
a good anvil does not fear the hammer
a good beginning is half the battle
a good beginning makes a good ending
a good deed is never lost
a good dog deserves a good bone
a good example is the best sermon
a good face is a letter of recommendation
a good jack makes a good jill
a good marksman may miss
a good name is better than riches
a good name is sooner lost than won
